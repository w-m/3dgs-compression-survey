\section{Datasets and Evaluation Statistics}

\subsection{Datasets}
% % describe all datasets briefly
Performance and quality assessment of 3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms is typically performed on multiple datasets. These datasets provide 3D scenes or objects with various properties, such as varying levels of detail, lighting conditions, and complexities, which allow for comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms. \\
In our survey we include Tanks and Temples\cite{TanksAndTemples}, MipNerf360\cite{MipNeRF360}, Deep Blending\cite{DeepBlending} as real-world datasets, and Synthetic NeRF\cite{SyntheticNeRF} as a synthetic dataset. From Tanks and Temples we include ``truck'' and ``train'' two unbounded outdoor scenes wich have a centered view point. The MipNerf360 dataset also has a centered view point but includes in- and outdoor scenes. The following scenes are included:  ``bicycle'', ``bonsai'', ``counter'', ``flowers'', ``garden'', ``kitchen'', ``room'', ``stump'', ``treehill''. From the Deep Blending dataset we include ``Dr Johnson'' and ``Palyroom'' two indoor scenes with a viewpoint directed outward. The synthetic scenes: chair, drums, ficus, hotdog, lego, material, mic, ship stem from the SyntheticNeRF dataset.

\subsection{Evaluation Statistics}
% !!! check gsplat-protocol / check downsampling factor in 3DGS; maybe in code.
