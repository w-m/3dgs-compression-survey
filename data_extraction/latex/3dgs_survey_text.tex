%     \subsection{3D Gaussian Splatting}

%         3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\cite{kerbl3Dgaussians} is a 3D scene representation based on rasterization used to perform novel view synthesis. While more traditonal methods rely on polygonal meshes or voxel grids, 3D Gaussian Splatting relys on a set of overlapping Gaussian functions (or "splats") to model the appearence of surfaces or volumes in 3D space. A "splat" in 3DGS is a 3D Gaussian ditribution that is described by its position (XYZ), Covariance (stretch and scale), color (RGB) and Alpha (transparency).
