### CompGS: Efficient 3D Scene Representation via Compressed Gaussian Splatting

 The paper CompGS proposes a hybrid primitive structure with anchor primitives to predict the attributes of coupled primitives, resulting in compact residual representations. A rate-constrained optimization scheme further enhances compactness by jointly minimizing both rendering distortion and bitrate. The bitrate of both anchor and coupled primitives ist modeled by entropy estimation.
