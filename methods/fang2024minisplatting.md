### Mini-Splatting: Representing Scenes with a Constrained Number of Gaussians
Mini-Splatting enhances Gaussian distribution through Blur Split, which refines Gaussians in blurred regions, and Depth Reinitialization, which repositions Gaussians based on newly generated depth points, calculated from the mid-point of ray intersections with Gaussian ellipsoids, thus avoiding artifacts from alpha blending. For simplification, Intersection Preserving retains Gaussians with the greatest visual impact, while Sampling maintains geometric integrity and rendering quality, reducing complexity.
