### MVG-Splatting: Multi-View Guided Gaussian Splatting with Adaptive Quantile-Based Geometric Consistency Densification
This method introduces adaptive depth density control to enhance 2D GS. 2D GS renders depth maps. In this method, the render depth maps are dynamically divided into near, mid, and far regions based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), focusing densification in under-reconstructed near and far areas. Geometric consistency checks and depth projection ensure adaptive densification without over-reconstruction, particularly in these critical regions.
