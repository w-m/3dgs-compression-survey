### FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering
This method introduces a multi-level training approach to customize and reduce the size of 3D Gaussian splatting. Starting from Structure from Motion (SfM) points, training is performed level by level. At each level, (a) a scale constraint is applied to control Gaussian size, and (b) overlap pruning is used to reduce excessive Gaussian overlap. The final model supports maximum-level rendering for high-quality output or selective multi-level rendering for more efficient performance.
