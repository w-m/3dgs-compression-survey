This method employs a global scoring approach to guide the addition of Gaussians, ensuring efficient densification. Each Gaussian is assigned a score based on four factors: 1) gradient, 2) pixel coverage, 3) per-view saliency, and 4) core attributes like opacity, depth, and scale. Gaussians with the top B scores, where B is the desired number of new Gaussians, are then split or cloned to optimize the scene's representation. By calculating a composite score that reflects both the sceneâ€™s structural complexity and visual importance, only the most critical areas are targeted for Gaussian splitting or cloning, resulting in more effective scene representation.
