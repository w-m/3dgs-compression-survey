### HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression

The paper proposes a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models by leveraging the mutual information between attributes of unorganized 3D Gaussians (anchors) and hash grid features. Using <insert>Scaffold-GS</insert> as a base model, HAC queries the hash grid by anchor location to predict anchor attribute distributions for efficient entropy coding. The framework introduces an Adaptive Quantization Module (AQM) to dynamically adjust quantization step sizes. Furthermore, this method employs adaptive offset masking with learnable masks to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors, by leveraging the pruning strategy introduced by <insert>Compact3DGS</insert> and additionally removing anchors if all the attached offsets are pruned.
