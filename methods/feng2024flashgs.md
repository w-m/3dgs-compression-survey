### FlashGS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Large-scale and High-resolution Rendering
The method reduces computational overhead by addressing inefficiencies in direct intersection calculations for elongated ellipses. It employs a two-stage filtering process: (1) a tightly tangent bounding box is used to set a coarse range, and (2) tiles intersecting the bounding box are checked for ellipse intersections. Additionally, FlashGS reduces global memory queries by employing a software pipelining approach that overlaps instruction dispatch, optimizing data retrieval and rendering efficiency.
