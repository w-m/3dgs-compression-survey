### Pixel-GS: Density Control with Pixel-aware Gradient for 3D Gaussian Splatting
The Pixel-GS method introduces a pixel-aware gradient to address under-reconstruction and needle-like artifacts in 3DGS. This gradient guides densification when the averaged scale gradient across multiple views exceeds a threshold, unlike the original method that only considers a single view. Additionally, Pixel-GS proposes a depth-dependent gradient scaling strategy to balance the influence of Gaussians on affected areas, as near-view Gaussians often receive an excessive number of gradients due to affecting too many pixels.
