### RAIN-GS: Relaxing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting
This method introduces three strategies to enhance 3D Gaussian splatting. First, it employs Sparse-Large-Variance (SLV) initialization, which begins with a small number of Gaussians to capture the overall structure of the point cloud. Second, progressive Gaussian low-pass filtering encourages initial large-scale Gaussians to cover wider areas. Third, the adaptive bound-expanding split (ABE-Split) algorithm moves Gaussians beyond their initial bounds, encouraging them to explore a broader space for more accurate geometry reconstruction.
