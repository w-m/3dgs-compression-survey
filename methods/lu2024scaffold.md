### Scaffold-GS: Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering

Scaffold-GS introduces anchor points that leverage scene structure to guide the distribution of local 3D Gaussians. Attributes like opacity, color, rotation, and scale are dynamically predicted for Gaussians linked to each anchor within the viewing frustum, enabling adaptation to different viewing directions and distances. Initial anchor points are derived by voxelizing the sparse, irregular point cloud from Structure from Motion (SfM), forming a regular grid. To refine and grow the anchors, Gaussians are spatially quantized using voxels, with new anchors created at the centers of significant voxels, identified by their average gradient over N training steps. Random elimination and opacity-based pruning regulate anchor growth and refinement.
