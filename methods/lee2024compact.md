### Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field

This approach introduces a Gaussian volume mask to prune non-essential Gaussians and a compact attribute representation for both view-dependent color and geometric attributes. The volume-based masking strategy combines opacity and scale to selectively remove redundant Gaussians. For color attribute compression, spatial redundancy is exploited by incorporating a grid-based (Instant-NGP) neural field, allowing efficient representation of view-dependent colors without storing attributes per Gaussian. Given the limited variation in scale and rotation, geometric attribute compression employs a compact codebook-based representation to identify and reuse similar geometries across the scene. Additionally, the authors propose quantization and entropy-coding as post-processing steps for further compression.
