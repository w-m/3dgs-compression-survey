### MesonGS: Post-training Compression of 3D Gaussians via Efficient Attribute Transformation

MesonGS employs universal Gaussian pruning by evaluating the importance of Gaussians through forward propagation, considering both view-dependent and view-independent features. It transforms rotation quaternions into Euler angles to reduce storage requirements and applies region adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) to reduce entropy in key attributes. Block quantization is performed on attribute channels by dividing them into multiple blocks and perform quantization for each block individually, using vector quantization for compressing less important attributes. Geometry is compressed using an octree, and all elements are packed with the LZ77 codec. A finetune scheme is implemented post-training to restore quality.
