### SUNDAE: Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation
This method combines graph-based pruning of Gaussian primitives with a convolutional neural network to retain high-frequency details. First, it "warms up" the 3D Gaussian field before applying a graph-based pruning strategy. The pruning step uses a graph built on the spatial relationships between the Gaussians and applies a band-limited graph filter to selectively down-sample, preserving important features. A convolutional neural network is then used to compensate for any losses caused by the pruning, ensuring that both high-frequency details and general low-frequency features are retained.
