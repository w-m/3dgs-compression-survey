### Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting with Optimized Feature Planes and Standard Video Codecs

This method~\cite{lee2025compression3dgaussiansplatting} introduces an effective approach for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting by employing optimized feature planes and integrating them with standard video codecs. More specifically CodecGS introduces progressive tri-planes, where the tri-plane takes 3D point positions x as input and predicts the corresponding attributes for each point. A two-phase training, starting with standard 3DGS~\cite{kerbl3Dgaussians} training followed by feature plane training ensures densification is consistent. Progressive training addresses the instability of feature plane training due to sparse 3DGS signals. DCT entropy modeling is employed to transform the feature planes. After training, feature planes are normalized and converted to 16-bit integers, corresponding to the YUV 16-bit format, and are encoded by a standard video codec.
