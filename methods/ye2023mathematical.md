### gsplat

This approach combines 3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (3DGS-MCMC) with compression techniques from the "Self-Organizing Gaussians" paper and "Making Gaussian Splats more smaller". It is implemented in gsplat, an open-source library for CUDA-accelerated differentiable rasterization of 3D gaussians with Python bindings. The library is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields", but gsplat is faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features.
