### gsplat

gsplat is an open-source library for CUDA-accelerated differentiable rasterization of 3D gaussians with Python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields", but gsplat is faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features.
